The main objective of this project is to analyse the Yelp reviews and understand if the review is positive, negative or neutral.
We have achieved this objective by implementing four supervised machine learning algorithms -

1. Naive Bayes Classification

2. Support Vector Machines

3. Random Forest

4. Decision Trees
